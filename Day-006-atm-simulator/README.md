## Overview
In Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python course, Day 06 focuses on **defining functions**, **function composition**, and **indefinite iteration using `while` loops**. The course uses **Reeborg's World** (a browser-based robot simulation) to teach these concepts through hurdles and maze challenges.

Instead of submitting Reeborg-specific code (which only works in their environment), I built **real, practical Python applications** that demonstrate the same core concepts in a more meaningful and portfolio-friendly way.

### ATM Machine Simulator (`atm_simulator.py`)
A fully functional console-based ATM system that allows users to:
- Check account balance
- Deposit money with validation
- Withdraw money with insufficient funds protection
- View complete transaction history
- Print a receipt

**Key Features:**
- Clean menu-driven interface
- Input validation and error handling
- Persistent balance and transaction log
- Professional output formatting

---

## Concepts Practiced

- Defining and reusing custom functions (`check_balance`, `deposit`, `withdraw`, `print_receipt`)
- `while True` loops for continuous program execution
- Global variables for maintaining state
- Input validation using `try-except`
- Function decomposition and clean code structure
- Conditional logic inside loops

**Note:** This project replaces the Reeborg's World exercises with real-world style applications to better demonstrate practical understanding of Day 06 concepts.
