This is a simple and fun Python program that randomly chooses **who pays the bill** from a group of friends.  
It is a classic exercise to practice **Lists** and the **`random` module** in Python.

This project is part of **Day 04** of the 100 Days of Code challenge.

### Purpose
- Understand how to store multiple items using **Lists**
