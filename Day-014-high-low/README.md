# Higher Lower Game
## Day 14 Project - 100 Days of Python Pro Bootcamp

This is my implementation of the Higher Lower game, built as part of Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python Bootcamp.

### 🎮 What is this?
A simple terminal game that tests your knowledge of popular Instagram accounts. You have to guess which of two accounts has more followers.

The rules:
1. You get two options: A and B
2. Guess who has more followers
3. If you are right, you gain a point and keep playing. The winner becomes your next A for the next round
4. Try to get the highest streak you can!
