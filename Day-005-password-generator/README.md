# Day 05 – Password Generator

This is Day 05 of my 100 Days of Python series.  
In this project, I built a simple command-line password generator that creates secure passwords with:

- Lowercase letters
- Uppercase letters
- Numbers
- Symbols

---

## Features

- Lets you choose:
  - How many letters (a–z, A–Z)
  - How many numbers (0–9)
  - How many symbols (e.g. `!`, `#`, `$`, `%`, etc.)
- Generates two passwords:
  1. Letters → numbers → symbols (in that order)
  2. The same characters but randomly shuffled for better security

Both passwords are printed to the terminal.
