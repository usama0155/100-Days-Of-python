## About the Game

This project is a simple, interactive console-based game where the computer picks a random number, and the player tries to guess it. The game offers two difficulty levels: 'easy' (10 attempts) and 'hard' (5 attempts), giving players a choice in how challenging they want the experience to be. Hints are provided after each guess, indicating whether the guessed number is too high or too low.

## Features

*   **Random Number Generation:** A new secret number is chosen randomly for each game session.
*   **Difficulty Levels:**
    *   **Easy:** 10 attempts to guess the number.
    *   **Hard:** 5 attempts to guess the number.
*   **Interactive Hints:** Provides feedback ("Too high" or "Too low") after each guess.
*   **Attempt Tracker:** Displays the number of remaining attempts.
*   **Game Over Condition:** Ends the game if the player runs out of attempts.
*   **Engaging UI:** Includes an ASCII art logo for a fun welcome (requires `art.py`).

## How to Play

1.  Run the game script from your terminal.
2.  You'll be greeted with a welcome message and the game's logo.
3.  The game will ask you to choose a difficulty: type `easy` or `hard`.
4.  Enter your guesses one by one.
5.  The game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.
6.  Continue guessing until you find the number or run out of attempts!
